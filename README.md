# Random Quote App

An app that pulls a random quote using an [API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) and displays it for the user. The user can then tweet the quote by clicking the Twitter icon displayed in the window.

# Reflection

This is my answer to FreeCodeCamp's _Build a Random Quote Machine_ Front End Development Library Challenge. I modeled my desgin after the [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ) that was given.

The biggest challenge I faced working on this app was getting the animations to work correctly, especially the color transitions. I ended up using a pretty ugly function to handle them all. I wonder if there is a better solution? (I assume there is.)

This is not a perfect 1-to-1 replication of the example app that was given, however I feel like it is good enough, and I want to move on.
